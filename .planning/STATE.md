## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 10 phases derived from 24 requirements at comprehensive depth
- [Roadmap]: Phase 8 (Email) depends on Phase 6, not Phase 7 -- long document handling enhances but does not block email delivery
- [01-01]: Used hatchling as build backend for clean src-layout support
- [01-01]: pydantic-settings[yaml] extra pulls in PyYAML as transitive dependency for Plan 02 config

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: REGDOCS internal API structure unknown -- must be discovered during Phase 2 execution
- [Phase 5]: Claude CLI subprocess invocation details underdocumented -- needs prototyping early in Phase 5
